Hi, my name is Dawid Wi≈õniewski.

I'm a PhD student at the Faculty of Computing and Telecomunication, Poznan University of Technology Poland and Senior Deep Learning Developer at APPLICA.AI.
In my PhD thesis, I'm trying to translate natural language questions into SPARQL-OWL queries to make the ontology authoring process easier and quicker to perform.

My research interests focus on machine learning, knowledge graphs, computational linguistics.
